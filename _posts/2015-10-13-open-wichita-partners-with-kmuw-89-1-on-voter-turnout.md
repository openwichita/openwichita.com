*Breaking news*—Open Wichita’s Voter Turnout project has joined forces with public radio station KMUW 89.1 to work together toward a future where more Wichitans vote more regularly on the matters that directly impact their lives. 

I caught up with KMUW General Manager Debra Fraser and Open Wichita founder Seth Etter to find out how the partnership came about and what their visions are for the project.

**Debra, how did you learn about Open Wichita?**

**DF:** I learned about Open Wichita from Seth when we met at a Third Thursday mixer at Public. I’d heard of Open Wichita, DevICT, and Startup Wichita, but didn’t know what it all meant.

**Seth?**

**SE:** We are very excited to have KMUW as a partner on this project. With them involved we can rest assured that we will have high-quality and relevant information within the application.

**Where does the project stand right now?**

**DF:** The project is on paper right now, with just a shell in place to use in a grant proposal. KMUW already plans a large project in 2016 called: Engage ICT: Democracy on Tap. In preparation, we have organized an Engagement Department of three employees, including two brand new full-time positions. In addition, we applied to the Knight Foundation to help with those salaries the first year in order to get Engage ICT off the ground.  Knight has several different grant projects throughout the year, and the week we met Seth, I'd just heard about the next one called Knight News Challenge: How might we make data work for individuals and communities?  KMUW already planned to focus on reaching younger potential voters with the Engage ICT project, which includes monthly conversations in places like Public. When Seth mentioned his idea for an APP to encourage younger voters, based on data...it was an obvious fit. 

**And what’s the status on Open Wichita’s end?**

**SE:** We have a team of individuals around the project within Open Wichita and the code base has been started. It’s still in early phases but we have defined an initial set of features that we can launch the platform with. We also have a lot of ideas on how to improve it even more in the future. The app is going to allow citizens to see upcoming ballots, the questions that will be on them, and information around the issue and each of the possible choices. Future considerations include user profiles that allow people to “cast their vote” within the app and have discussion to show how the Wichita population currently feels about an issue.

**What is your vision for the project?**

**DF:**  We hope this project will make voting more accessible. We want to encourage people to register to vote, then help them see why it matters.  If we host the monthly conversations, provide in-depth news coverage and integrate Seth's app...I believe we'll succeed. 

**SE:** My vision for the project is to create a platform that allows citizens to more easily be informed on upcoming ballot questions. I believe many people find it difficult to stay informed on issues and often don’t know the best way to find the information. Couple that with the distrust that some have with politics and media sources and the result is not knowing what choices to make when voting. This platform would provide a single place to get unbiased compiled information so that voters can be informed quickly and easily. We also want to highlight why the person should care about different issues and how it affects their lives.

**Why does voter turnout matter?**

**SE:** Recent voter turnout in Wichita has been pretty dismal. It’s important that all citizens have an opportunity to voice their opinion on voting issues. Open Wichita’s mission is to improve our city through technology. Having a more informed citizen-base here will always be a good thing. More people getting out to vote on issues will also be a good thing. The city is at an important point in our history and we have to encourage people to be actively engaged in the direction of our community. Being well-informed and getting out to vote on issues is one of the best ways to make that happen.

**DF:** This subject is important to KMUW because we're committed to "making Wichita even better" and it's widely agreed that greater voter turn-out would be good for Wichita.
