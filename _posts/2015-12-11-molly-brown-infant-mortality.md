Molly Brown, the Program Coordinator of Baby Talk, stopped by our December open hack night to talk about infant mortality and learn more about Open Wichita's Infant-Info project [(see previous post to get up to speed on Infant-Info).](http://openwichita.org/infant-info-project-highlight/) Baby Talk is an prenatal, pregnancy, and infant care education initiative powered by the [Medical Society of Sedgwick County](http://www.mssconline.org/index.php/baby-talk/), and Brown was referred to open hack night by our good friend Mike Mayta, CIO of the City of Wichita.

"Infant mortality is actually an indicator of overall community health," Brown noted. "It's about access to food, access to transportation, being able to go to the doctor...if our infant mortality is high, then that tells me as a community member that maybe our community health isn't where it should be and we should be addressing some of these things."
