Wichita Public Librarian and Open Wichita member Britten Kuckelman talks about her application to the 2016 Knight News Challenge -- The Civic Hackerspace Library. The challenge posed the question "how might libraries serve 21st century information needs?" and Britten answers with her ideas about how the Wichita Public Library could serve as a hub for groups like Open Wichita, Women Who Code, DevICT, and members of the community to work together to push civic innovation forward.
