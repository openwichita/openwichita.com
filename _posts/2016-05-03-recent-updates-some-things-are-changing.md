This year has brought quite a bit of change for Open Wichita, and in a very very good way! I wanted to write up a quick post to highlight some of these changes and give updates on what's to come.

## Why change?

When Open Wichita started, it was incredibly exciting. From the get-go we had immense support from the city and other community based organizations, we had great numbers around event attendance, participation, and projects in motion.

These all seemed like signs of success to me. But really, **what were we accomplishing?**

## Measuring success

Sometimes it can be very difficult to measure success. There are easy numbers to grab for such as event attendance, money raised, meetings had, press appearances, projects, etc etc. But the question you have to ask is "are these things in line with the mission of my organization?"

They are all good indicators of *something*, but they might not be indicative of real impact had on the community. At Open Wichita, our goal is just that: **real impact on real people**.

## The issues

All of these things started coming to light to me recently because those misleading "success" indicators were starting to dwindle. Projects were starting to stand-still and event attendance was starting to go down.

At first this worried me. Eventually I saw it for what it was: **a chance to rethink our direction and make the necessary changes to align with our goals**. Sometimes it takes a wake up call to push you back in the direction you originally intended to go.

After giving some thought to these symptoms and discussing them with the fantastic people who continued to attend the events and be involved, we've come to highlight two primary issues:

1. We spent too much time asking people for involvement and not giving enough back to them (and the community) in return.
2. By focusing on the false metric of number of projects in progress we were spreading resources too thin to truly accomplish things of value.

## So, now what?

Based on the two issues outlined above, here's what we're thinking.

**Change #1**: Start hosting events once a month that are purely educational. Offer skill training, subject matter coverage, and other presentations or workshops in the area of civic technology.

It's obvious once you think about it, but we were missing the fact that the community will be able to understand and utilize the concepts in civic tech if they're offered training around them. This strengthens the individuals in our community and encourages them to use those skills for further involvement, either with Open Wichita or through other community involvement.

**Change #2**: Have a single "featured project" that we will pool the majority of our resources towards.

Instead of spreading ourselves too thin on as many projects as possible, we'll be having a single "featured" project or effort that we organize around. This doesn't mean you *have* to work on this project. We will always support any and every civic tech project that comes our way. But our primary efforts, workshops, meetings, etc, will be focused on one particular thing.

*Side note: I'll be writing about our current effort soon! Stay tuned.*

## Onward and upward!

That pretty much concludes the organizational changes. I try to avoid writing posts that are too long, so I'm going to cut it off right there. All in all, I think these changes will put us more in line with having the community impact that we are set out for. We hope you do as well :)
