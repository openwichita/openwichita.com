Check out this fantastic article that the Wichita Eagle's Gabriella Dunn published about [ICT Food Circle](https://www.kansas.com/news/local/article53008935.html), an initiative to encourage people to eat local. 

We're thrilled about the exposure and momentum that Mikel is bringing to the project, and invite you to join the conversation on the [ICT Food Circle Facebook page ](https://www.facebook.com/Ictfoodcircle/?fref=ts) or [visit the website.](https://ictfoodcircle.org)

While you're at it, check out the video we made about the ICT Food Circle Project:
