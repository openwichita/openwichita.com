It's been just over one year since Open Wichita became a group. We held our very first on the National Day of Civic Hacking in 2015. We have grown a lot in the last year, and so has our city. This year we hosted our biggest event yet in partnership with the largest event in Kansas. Hackathon ICT at Riverfest!

## Let's look at the numbers!

We had 13 teams made up of 43 participants. The event lasted 30 hours, and the teams worked on their projects for 24 of those. The whole thing was topped off by our great sponsors and over 30 fantastic volunteers supporting the whole operation.

Needless to say, we were thrilled to see so many people in Wichita who were eager to get involved in civic technology. Witnessing people who care for their community and are willing to give a hand towards making it better is always a humbling experience.

## Kicking things off

Festivities began at 11 AM on Saturday June 4th with opening remarks from Seamus Kraft, Executive Director of [The OpenGov Foundation](https://opengovfoundation.org/). He reminded us all that what we were doing was important and a model for other citizens to follow. That we were "civic superheroes" doing our part to make our city a better place.

Immediately following were the pitches from a number of community members from various backgrounds, all with great ideas. Ideas about providing easier access to resources for veterans, military members, and their families. Ideas about encouraging community street cleanups and about making it easier to find dining options for those with dietary restrictions.

Community members had the opportunity to share their vision for a solution to the various issues facing people in Wichita, and they used that opportunity to mobilize and create!

## Then the work began

We ended up with 13 teams. Their focus was diverse, but their energy was all the same. A gathering of people ready and excited to spend their weekend working on awesome projects. The teams were (in no particular order):

* **Military Resources** - An easy to use website to find resources for veterans, military and their families.
* **Skiphr** - A way to connect individuals to small jobs or gig work.
* [**WINTA**](https://wintalliance.org) - Informational website about the Wichita Interdisciplinary Neurological Trauma Alliance.
* [**TinyLib**](https://tinylib.herokuapp.com) - Web application for finding and using Little Free Libraries.

* **Fran the Chatbot** - A friendly chatbot to connect homeless and others in need with the necessary resources.
* [**Pac Wichita**](https://www.facebook.com/events/1032645476829134/) - A location based game for getting Wichitans out exploring and to promote local business and culture.
* **LinkICT** - An implementation of the [Ohana API](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api) and [web search interface](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-web-search) for the city of Wichita (more on this later).
* [**EasyAR**](https://github.com/kjcodeacct/easy-earp-service) - A [mobile](https://github.com/kjcodeacct/easy-earp-app) and [web](https://github.com/kjcodeacct/easy-earp-webpanel) application for replacing the paper system of non critical crash reporting.

The teams were formed and work began immediately! Our volunteers along with the fine folks at Wichita Festivals were bringing in meals and accommodating the needs of participants, and members of the public were dropping in to get a glimpse of the action. Some individuals were even convinced to stick around and participate!

Did I mention the RC plane competition that was happening close by? The mid-air battles taking place provided us plenty of extra entertainment while participants hacked away at the ideas.

Work continued through the late hours of the night. A small handful of vigilant contributors even used the air mattresses donated by Coleman to stake out the entire 24 hours. There was no short supply of dedication here.

## Work stopped at noon on Sunday

The teams were now getting ready for their presentations. All their hard work had built up to the coming moments where they revealed their ideas and the progress they made on them over the last 24 hours. More members of the public were showing up to see what the community had come up with.

## Next steps

Hackathons are great for generating excitement, building community, and showing what's possible with collaboration and creative thinking about issues in our cities. Although projects born at these events don't always carry on, we can say with certainty that at least a few things will be moving forward.

**Pac Wichita** hosted their first event in conjunction with [Matano](https://matano.co/) to unveil their GPS-enabled game. All the proceeds from this event went to [support Matano in their Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/toby-kriwiel/matano-fair-trade-sports-apparel-for-the-everyday?token=a25045de).

**LinkICT (Ohana)** will become the basis of focus for Open Wichita for the time being. We've recognized that it tackles many needs that we have been made aware of in the community, so we will be dedicating resources to it's rollout.

**EasyAR, SOC in a BOX and Pac Wichita** will all be presenting their ideas to the City Manager so the city can offer support or resources for their endeavors. They will also be recognized with a resolution by the Wichita City Council for the efforts they've put in towards the good of our community.
