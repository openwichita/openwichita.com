This is Andrew, the President of Guiding Paws, an organization that matches visually impaired people with guide dogs. Pictured with Andrew is Orzo, his trusted companion, who, at the age of nine human years, is on the verge of retirement.

Andrew stopped in to Open Wichita's Hack Night tonight to talk about why Wichita's transit system urgently needs an app that serves all citizens, especially the visually impaired.

Andrew's phone keeps him in touch with the world, but he could use additional help with getting around Wichita--nothing currently exists on his phone for that particular issue.

Andrew and Seth know one another from Seth's days at HighTouch. Their offices were on the same floor, which gave them plenty of opportunities to get to know one another.

Andrew--it was a pleasure meeting you and we've heard your feedback loud and clear. We look forward to working with you more as this project develops.

Andrew's Organization, Guiding Paws, is hosting a fundraiser at Abode Venue on Sunday, August 23rd, from 5-10 PM. The event will feature live jazz, a silent auction, door prizes, and much more.
