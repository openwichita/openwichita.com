We here at Open Wichita are proud to introduce you to the Infant-Info initiative, which was created out of the friendship between developer Brian Buller and healthcare provider Rachel Cheek. Let's hear about it in their own words...

**So, what is Infant-Info all about?**

**Rachel:** I am a health care provider myself and I was recently made aware of an entire set of services that would have been wonderful for women under my care but I had never provided because I didn't know they existed. It became clear that there is a gap between women and the services they need because of the lack of provider knowledge. I think that this project will help fill that gap.

**Brian:** There is big list of resources in the Wichita area that are frequently updated. It doesn't make sense to distribute that list in any way other than online, so they got connected with Open Wichita.

**Why is this project important to Wichita right now?**

**Rachel:** Wichita has a very high infant mortality rate, particularly in the African American populations. It's so important to address this problem. There are several organizations working on this issue but due to the complexity of the problem, progress is slow. This project, I hope, will be just another step toward protecting Wichita's infants.

**Where does the project stand right now?**

**Brian:** The project is making good progress. We've got most of the application development done, we're just waiting to receive the list of resources from the group so that we can customize the application and database to the dataset.

**What is your vision for the project?**

**Rachel:** It is my hope that this project streamlines and optimizes the process of providing specialized aid services to pregnant women, mothers and infants who need them.

This project is a great example of how Open Wichita is *not* just a group for developers. Often, the most powerful ideas are realized when diverse members of the community couple their insight and expertise with our vast development resources. In other words, *we want to hear from you.*
