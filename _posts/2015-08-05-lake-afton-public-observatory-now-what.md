Wichitans were saddened [by the news](https://www.kansas.com/news/local/article27249676.html) that Lake Afton Public Observatory (LAPO) would "go dark forever" by the end of August 2015 after a 35-year run. It was, like so many of those fixtures of childhood memory, a place we just counted on always being there.

Thankfully, the news of LAPO's demise seems to have been premature.

The members of the [Kansas Astronomical Observers ](https://www.kaowichita.com) and LAPO volunteers held a meeting at the Johnson Controls facility last night to discuss LAPO's future. Several members of Open Wichita attended as well, and KSN and KWCH news showed up to cover the proceedings.

Key takeaway from the meeting? The prospects of LAPO's future are positive.

While the final business proposal for the takeover of LAPO's 501c3 that KAO will present to the Sedgwick County Commission is still under construction, it was clear that volunteer resources were not an issue. 26 people at the meeting committed their time to LAPO's operation on Friday and Saturday nights, and others committed their skills and expertise to the daily operation needs of the facility.

We at Open Wichita have committed our resources toward the development of a solid, strategic online presence for LAPO. This will include web development, social media, marketing, audio/video production, and content creation as needed. 

From a PR standpoint, the news of LAPO's closing will be a challenge to overcome. For some reason, phrases like "the end" and "going dark forever" tend to stick in the mind more firmly than "business as usual." We will need to move quickly and consistently to spread the word that LAPO will remain open and be better than ever, provided the Sedgwick County Commission approves the plan. 

I've never been much of an astronomy enthusiast, but my wife and I visit LAPO several times a year because we love the experience. We have a daughter on the way, so it has become especially important to me that organizations like this will remain for her to enjoy when the time comes. To me, LAPO is a site for quiet contemplation of our place in the universe--a true portal to the stars only thirty minutes outside of town. Whether its outside on the pad underneath the dark Kansas sky, or waiting in line for a look into the telescope inside, LAPO provides a sense of meditative, earthly togetherness that no online telescope image could ever reproduce.
