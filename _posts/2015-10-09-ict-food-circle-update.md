ICT Food Circle is excited to announce some big steps forward, proving that Open Data doesn't just take place in the digital world. Aiming to connect local food producers, distributors, and consumers interested in eating fresh and local, ICT Food Circle is gearing up to fill a void--and a lot of discerning stomachs, as well. 

ICT Food Circle founder Mikel Bowyer, a veteran of the foodservice industry, became interested in the project out of concern for the quality of food we consume."The first stage of ICT Food Circle is our farmer directory," Bowyer said. "In the future, our goals include moving out into the community as a resource for local organic foods. Coupled with expos, events and educational efforts, we will reconnect our community with local farms. We will operate as a non profit as a division of MakeICT, and hope to create sustainability within the Wichita area." 

"I'm very interested in eating real food and produce from local farmers and providing it for my family as well," said ICT Food Circle team member Rebecca Morris, who has contributed graphic design and web development expertise to the project. Harsh Oza, who gathers information for the ICT Food Circle directory, agreed. "I want quality food and to support the local economy at the same time."
