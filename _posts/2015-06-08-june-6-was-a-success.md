**Wichita just participated in our first ever [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org)!** This is a huge accomplishment for us. You better believe we will be participating each year going forward now :)

To start off, huge thanks to everyone who attended and volunteered and to all of our [awesome sponsors](http://openwichita.org/sponsors). This could not have happened without everyone involved. It's amazing to see a great group of people come together for something like this.

It's always a bit nerve-wracking when it's the first time you're trying to get a new group going in Wichita. Even more so when you're asking people to come volunteer their time for an entire Saturday to work on civic issues. Despite all that, we had an excellent turnout, and saw some really cool projects.

We will be posting pictures and more from the day sometime soon, so stay posted! If you want to see some information on the projects that came out of the day, visit the [projects page](http://openwichita.org/projects).
