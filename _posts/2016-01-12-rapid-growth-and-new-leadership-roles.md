Open Wichita started during the Summer of 2015 as a half-thought-out idea to create a civic hacking community in Wichita, following in the footsteps of other [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org) brigades around the country.

The powers of open data and grassroots efforts to improve a city with technology were wildly apparent in certain areas of the world, so why not make it happen here? It was worth a shot, at least.

**To much surprise, it grew, very quickly.**

Turns out there are a lot of individuals in Wichita who care about making their city a better place, however they can. It is this civically-focused mentality that I think sets Wichita apart from many communities. We love our community and are willing to do whatever we can to make it more awesome.

We're also willing to empower others to do the same, no matter who they are or what they do. If someone wants to accomplish something, we all band together to help them make that happen.

**That's what Open Wichita is about.**

It's been very humbling. Numerous people from various walks of life came to our meetups with awesome ideas to make Wichita better. The work that has been put in is **100% volunteer time**, driven purely by a passion to do something good for the community.

Some of the things we have going on are:

* [An initiative to lower infant mortality rates](http://openwichita.org/infant-info-project-highlight/)
* [A way to connect Wichitans with local food sources](http://openwichita.org/wichita-eagle-features-ict-food-circle/)
* [Improved digital tooling for local public transit](http://openwichita.org/busict-project-update/)
* [A partnership with KMUW to increase voter education](http://openwichita.org/open-wichita-partners-with-kmuw-89-1-on-voter-turnout/)
* [Pursuit of an Open Data policy for the city of Wichita](http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article47093260.html)
* [A collaboration with Riverfest for a large scale civic hackathon](http://openwichita.org/open-wichita-in-the-news/)

..and that's not everything. Clearly, the last 6 months have been busy!

**Time to get serious.**

This kind of growth requires better organization and administration with Open Wichita. It is for that reason that specific leadership positions have been created so we can keep up with all the forward movement.

So, without further ado, here are the positions and their chosen appointees:

* **Director (Seth Etter)** - Responsible for overall organizational direction, wrangles the rest of the leadership team.
* **Project Coordinator (Michael Neth)** - Ensures individual projects can move forward and assists with new project onboarding.
* **Communications Director (Aaron Wirtz)** - Keeps Open Wichita engaged with the community through coverage of our efforts.
* **Policy Advisor (Jason Van DeCreek)** - Advises and coordinates our government policy efforts, including Open Data policy.
* **Community Engagement Director (Ben Blankley)** - Coordinates relationships with other local community organizations.
* **Data Curator (Britten Kuckelman)** - Our connection to the vast amount and variety of data sets at our disposal.
* **City Representative (Mike Mayta)** - Provides connection to local government for data, collaboration, etc.

These individuals have all been chosen because they were each already acting in this capacity and have done so by their own desire to be involved.

**Open Wichita would be nowhere without the effort of each of the individuals involved at the leadership level, project level, and otherwise.** There is no way to express my gratitude to every person who has been a part of the group up until this point. You are all truly awesome people, I can't thank you enough.

**But this is just the beginning.**

With the Open Data policy in progress, the Riverfest Hackathon on the horizon, and multiple projects being worked on, Open Wichita is on the tipping point of making a huge impact on this city.

Now is the time to get involved! [Join the group on meetup](http://meetup.com/openwichita) and come out to one of our hack nights to see what we're all about. You can also check out [several other ways of connecting](http://openwichita.org/talk). There's no time like the present!
