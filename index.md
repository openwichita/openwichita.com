# What is Open Wichita

**Our mission is to** provide a connecting point for those interested in the
cross-section of technology and local civic involvement. We are Wichitaâ€™s <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/">Code
For America</a> brigade and a program of
<a href="https://devict.org/">devICT</a>.

We are a community of individuals who want to help citizens and government solve
problems with data and code, and empower others with the necessary skills to do
the same.

We believe that technology is a powerful force that can fundamentally change the
way we participate in city living. We also believe that the accessibility of
technology empowers anyone to create something that makes a major difference.

**To get involved**, connect with us on the <a href="https://openwichita.org/devict.org/slack">devICT Slack
group</a> (channel:
<a href="https://devict.slack.com/messages/C4KJ8FL4A/">#openwichita</a>),
